      <p>
        <strong>Informal Negotiations</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy,
        or claim related to these Terms of Use (each a &ldquo;Dispute" and
        collectively, the &ldquo;Disputes") brought by either you or us
        (individually, a &ldquo;Party" and collectively, the &ldquo;Parties"),

        commence upon written notice from one Party to the other Party.

        courts located in the Bahamas, and the Parties hereby consent to, and
        waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction, and forum non

      <h1>MISCELLANEOUS</h1>
      <p>
        These Terms of Use and any policies or operating rules posted by us on
        the Site constitute the entire agreement and understanding between you
        and us. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of
        these Terms of use shall not operate as a waiver of such right or
        provision. These Terms of Use operate to the fullest extent permissible
        by law. We may assign any or all of our rights and obligations to others
        at any time. We shall not be responsible or liable for any loss, damage,
        delay, or failure to act caused by any cause beyond our reasonable
        control. If any provision or part of a provision of these Terms of Use
        is determined to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that provision or
        part of the provision is deemed severable from these Terms of Use and
        does not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining
        provisions. There is no joint venture, partnership, employment or agency
        relationship created between you and us as a result of these Terms of
        Use or use of the Site. You agree that these Terms of Use will not be
        construed against us by virtue of having drafted them. You hereby waive
        any and all defenses you may have based on the electronic form of these
        Terms of Use and the lack of signing by the parties hereto to execute
        these Terms of Use.
